              ;   On Commodore computers, the streams consist of four kinds of symbols
              ;   that denote different kinds of low-to-high-to-low transitions on the
              ;   read or write signals of the Commodore tape interface.
              ;
              ;   1) A break in the communications, or a pulse with very long cycle time.
              ;
              ;   2) A short pulse, whose cycle time typically ranges from 296 to 424
              ;      microseconds, depending on the computer model.
              ;
              ;   3) A medium-length pulse, whose cycle time typically ranges from
              ;      440 to 576 microseconds, depending on the computer model.
              ;
              ;   4) A long pulse, whose cycle time typically ranges from 600 to 744
              ;      microseconds, depending on the computer model.
              ;
              ; The actual interpretation of the serial data takes a little more work to
              ; explain. The typical ROM tape loader (and the turbo loaders) will
              ; initialize a timer with a specified value and start it counting down. If
              ; either the tape data changes or the timer runs out, an IRQ will occur. The
              ; loader will determine which condition caused the IRQ. If the tape data
              ; changed before the timer ran out, we have a short pulse, or a "0" bit. If
              ; the timer ran out first, we have a long pulse, or a "1" bit. Doing this
              ; continuously and we decode the entire file.
